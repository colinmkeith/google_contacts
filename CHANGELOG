2.12  08/04/2013
- Added delay to prevent google errors due to loading too fast.  Previous
versions would cause over quota errors.  If you get these errors with this
version, look at line 684 in google-contacts.php and increase the number. 
The higher the number, the slower the load is.  If the number is too small,
google will complain because you are hitting their server too fast.
